Starcry is a generative art tool with a declarative interface for creating
structured objects and defining their behaviors. Inspired by Photoshop, objects
are hierarchical and support Blending Modes.

Leveraging the V8 JavaScript engine, Starcry allows users to fully customize
behaviors through scripting, with inspiration taken Processing.
While offering a more specialized feature set, Starcry has some unique
capabilities. Here's a list of features:

* Objects can be: circles, ellipses, lines, text, scripts.
* Objects have general properties, location, behaviors, styling, movement, etc.
* Objects can be imported from other scripts, to help reduce script complexity.
* Scenes organize roughly initial setups and give some structure to videos.
* Objects can be parents of other objects and can also dynamically spawn more objects.
* Objects can pass on properties to their descendants, or modify their own.
* Integrated video generation support, easy to generate a video in realtime.
* EXR image format support for individual frames, for more powerful post-processing capabilities.
* Motion blur can be enabled or disabled.
* Various Perlin Noise textures available, and flexible gradients system.
* Out-of-the-box gravity behavior feature, and dynamic object interactions.
* First-class support for object intersections in the UI (W.I.P.).
* Vector-based design, enabling resizing to any resolution
