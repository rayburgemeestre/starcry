## Background

This is a new version of Starcry which was originally a rendering engine with a desktop UI (see screenshot).
It aimed to be the *Photoshop for Video*, albeit vector-based.
The first version was already quite advanced with features including Motion blur, Textures, Gradients, Polygons, Lines, Circles, Ellipses, Rectangles.
Gravity effects, all kinds of Motions, Behaviors, Custom Easing (Linear, Exponential, ..), etc., etc.
However, the code got a little unmaintainable which led to this rewrite.

One of the videos that could be rendered with the old system can be found [here][https://vimeo.com/20206213].
